//use the counter to increment the counter for each order number, so that each order has a unique order number.
//you will pass in a toppings object into your function. So you'll have call your function for each toppings object, like below

//yourFunctionName(toppings1);
//yourFunctionName(toppings2);

//finally, build one more object, toppings3, populated with the same keys as toppings1 and toppings2. Give the keys values and
//pass it into your function.
